Image Widget
------------


A simple widget to display different types of images/filters *inplace*.

Options:

- grey
- ascii


Annotation
----------

My motivation for this project was to simplify the embedding of a JavaScript Plugin. While it's an usual approach
to put the (late) loading scripts at the end of the website, for inplace elements like images/videos/audio this would
be unnecessary. To modify them - the <script> can be at the point where the original media type should be present.
